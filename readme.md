```

Install dependencies of tailwind

Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

## Prerequisites

You need to have some understanding of tailwind
Also have Node.js installed on the machine you'll
be using to run this project on



## What I used to make this project

API - https://www.weatherapi.com/
  - You'll need an account from this website so you can be able to integrate it to your project
  - I think they're free version runs for a week or something of which is the plan I used
  - So this project might not really work by the time you download it so you'll definetely need
    to create your own account and change my API KEY 
    
    You'll find the variable in the script.js file as API_KEY so just remove mine and put yours
    
Languages
  - Tailwind css - https://tailwindcss.com/
  - HTML 
  - JS
  
 ## Final thoughts
 
 This project was just for me to learn how to integrate an API to a website and how to use JSON files
